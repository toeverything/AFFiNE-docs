Below we have prepared some general tips on being a brand ambassador - and we hope to help you grow and improve your own brand. These apply generally and are not specific to AFFiNE.

### **Some tips and tricks**

#### 1) Create **yourself through your profile**

First-impressions count and particularly with an online persona ‚Äì you might only have a few seconds before someone clicks away. So, what might you be able to do?

* Write an interesting bio. This will often be the first thing people see and can provide important details about you.
* Followers, subscribers and engagement. These are all important factors for you to consider ‚Äì don‚Äôt worry if you are starting small, genuine engagement can help you build these up over time.
* Build yourself. Your image is important ‚Äì build yourself as a brand and let people know who you are and‚Ä¶
* What makes you different? Why should people follow you and engage with you? What sets you apart from everyone else online?
* Be positive and genuine. Others are more willing to participate if they feel they are being listened to and engaged with.
* Keywords. Search is going to be a popular way people can find you ‚Äì so you should make sure you are using the right keywords and tags.

#### 2) Be active

You don‚Äôt have to be online 24/7 but being active will mean followers are more likely to stick around and mention you to others. Engage in community content and reply to some of the comments and engage with your own community.

#### 3) Post meaningful content

Being active doesn‚Äôt mean posting just because you can. Content should be useful and engaging ‚Äì targeted for the audience. Content can be tailored for different communities and users; it should feel natural and engaging ‚Äì not forced.

#### 4) Build yourself

Don‚Äôt forget about yourself. You can build up your own brand, influence and followers. Want to make a series of content? A custom tag for yourself? Don‚Äôt forget about yourself.

#### 5) Who is your audience?

Consider where and who you are posting to. What‚Äôs their interest and do you feel the content you are posting would truly be something that they would have a genuine interest in and might engage with.

#### 6) Be passionate

As an ambassador you should enjoy what you are doing and feel passionate about the product you are promoting. This will feed into your content, your replies and your engagement ‚Äì followers will be able to catch your enthusiasm and feel more positive about you and your content.

#### 7) Network

Whether its online or offline ‚Äì networking is super useful. You can learn more from different people, engage with different groups and expand your network with their network. Other ambassadors, even competitor products ‚Äì the followers in the circles likely share similar interests and are more likely to engage.

#### 8) Be professional

Be professional. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have fun and engage with users in creativity ways ‚Äì but it does mean you need to consider your overall image and be thoughtful how you respond and engage with followers. For example, how you deal with conflict and reply to others can often be seen publicly for everyone to judge.

#### 9) Don‚Äôt take shortcuts

Thinking about buying followers? Paying for engagement? It doesn‚Äôt work. Forget about most probably being bots‚Ä¶ but the community you want to grow will unlikely match with the followers you get. Engagement is most important. A slow growth of genuinely interested followers will do you and your account much better than fast growth without engagement.

#### 10) Think about marketing

Online marketing will help with social reach and engagement. There are a wide range of courses online that can help with specific social platforms, SEO or any other wide range of areas. From free courses to paid ones, there‚Äôs a lot of content available online to help you learn and improve further.
