* Be passionate about AFFiNE

That's it, nearly..

You can show your passion through various ways:

* **Teach and/or share AFFiNE.** From making tutorials and guides, to engaging with communities and spreading the word about us.
* **Connect and share AFFiNE.** Participate in the AFFiNE communities actively - particularly engaging in both the public and ambassador categories within Discord.

AFFiNE is building a collaborative community that will continually build upon itself everyday. All members are encouraged to share their learnings and creations, ask for feedback, and help each other grow. Members of the AFFiNE team will be around doing the same.
