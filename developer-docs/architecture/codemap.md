### CodeMap Graph

TODO: Draw a graph here to show the connection of the frontend(Virgo and Phasor) with the backend(JWST and commender).

### Naming Conventions

Affine now consists of 3 major components. They are all named after astronomical telescopes, observatories or scientific concepts. These huge scientific instruments is what human built to search for the faintest light in the universe and hence expense the edge of our cognition of the world. In analogy, we hope Affine can serve as a good knowledge base for you and many, to disenchant the unclear, and to explore the unknown.

* The block editor, grid system and table components [editor-virgo.md](editor-virgo.md "mention")
  * It is named after the [Virgo interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/) in the Europe. It belongs to [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/index.php), one of the most successful scientific collaborations in human history.
* The whiteboard rendor and subcomponents [whiteboard-phasor.md](whiteboard-phasor.md "mention")
  * As a dom-based vector rendering platform, it is named after the concept of [phasor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor)
* The collaborative backend and database [collaboration-jwst.md](collaboration-jwst.md "mention")
  * Not to be confused with JSON Web Token, JWST is named after the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov/).
