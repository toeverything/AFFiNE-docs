# ðŸ’Ž Collaboration (JWST)

JWST is a set of collaborative backend and database implemented based on CRDTs.

It is the core to resolve conflicts between the duplication of data and manage the databases so that real-time collaboration and local-first storage is possible. It supports local storage and serve-side storage.

The support for decentralized storage will be supported soon.

We will also adding more general-purposed-friendly APIs so that JWST can be used for other projects aside from Affine, too.
