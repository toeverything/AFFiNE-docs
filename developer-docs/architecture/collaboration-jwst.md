# ðŸ’Ž Collaboration (JWST)

JWST is our collaborative backend and database which is implemented based on CRDT.

This component is critically in resolving conflicts between the duplication of data and managing the databases so that real-time collaboration and local-first storage is possible. With support for decentralized storage coming soon.

We will also adding more general-purposed-friendly APIs so that JWST can be utilized in other projects and is more developer friendly.
