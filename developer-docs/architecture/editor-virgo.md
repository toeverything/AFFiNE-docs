# ðŸ’« Editor (Virgo)

We built the block editor using [slatejs](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) as a base.

In the future, we hope to implement an out-of-the-box block editor that will make it simpler for all websites to provide a feature-rich document editor. Allowing developers to focus more on the development of their own business and provide users with more feature-rich software.
