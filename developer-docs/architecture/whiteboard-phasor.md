# ðŸ¦„ Whiteboard (Phasor)

We build whiteboard base on [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw), and add block editor support.

We want to break down the boundaries of traditional documents and whiteboards so that people can organize their thoughts, take minutes of meetings, etc. in a more intuitive way.
