# ðŸ¦„ Whiteboard (Phasor)

The whiteboard is built on [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw), and we added block editor support.

We want to break down the boundaries of traditional documents and whiteboards so that people can organize their thoughts in a more intuitive way, such as taking the minutes of meetings.
