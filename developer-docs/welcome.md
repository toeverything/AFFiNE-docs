## Non-Code Contributions

You want to help with this project, but you're not a developer? There are many ways you can help - even if you don't write code! You still give back your support and love as part of the AFFiNE community. Here are a few ideas.

* Answering questions from other users in the [Affine community](https://www.reddit.com/r/Affine/) that you can.
* Improve the documentation.
* Become an ambassador or evangelist for AFFiNE! Most software companies usually have a dedicated marketing team to get more users, but luckily we have a better option: it's you who are interested in AFFiNE!
  * Please share your experience with AFFiNE anywhere!
  * This can be anything:
    * Write a lifehack-style blog post about how you or your team uses AFFiNE to get things done.
    * Spread the word on social media platforms, getting more people to join AFFiNE's community: Product Hunt, Hacker Noon, Quora, Reddit, and Stack Overflow are all good choices.
    * Give a lightning talk at your local hackerspace about why you like AFFiNE.
    * Write a review of the pros and cons of similar open source applications.
    * Feel free to contact the AFFiNE team with any other suggestions!
